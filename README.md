# JOT Console
Convenience note taking app for the terminal.

## Convenient?
- Will write to `chat.log` by default
- Can append to the most recently modified `.log` file in the directory
- Will rotate files if you try to overwrite an existing log file
- Will write to a new file if the chosen filename is already open in another program
